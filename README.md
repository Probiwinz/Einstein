# Einstein is a NewtonOS emulator.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pguyot/Einstein.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pguyot/Einstein)
![CI macOS](https://github.com/pguyot/Einstein/workflows/CI%20macOS/badge.svg)

Einstein officially runs on macOS, iOS, and Ubuntu Linux with partial support for Android, 
Raspberry Pi, and Windows. 

A Newton ROM file is required to run Einstein.  We cannot distribute the ROM file.  If you 
own a Newton device, you may be able to dump your own ROM file from it.  
See [Dumping The Rom](../../wiki/Dumping-The-Rom) for more information.

Once you have Einstein up and running, refer to the 
[user manual](https://github.com/pguyot/Einstein/blob/master/Documentation/UserManual.pdf).
